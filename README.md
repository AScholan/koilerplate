# Koilerplate

One of my great frustrations when building notebooks for [kaggle](https://kaggle.com) 
is the amount of boilerplate code I always add to the top of each notebook.

The whole idea behind this package is that a simple import can pull in a lot of this
boilerplate and allow me to focus on the competition in hand.

## Not much here yet

At the moment, I've only just started putting together this package, so please don't be
too upset if it's a bit light-weight at the moment.

## Suggestions

Please add any suggestions to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/AScholan/koilerplate/issues)
and I'll try and get back to you.
